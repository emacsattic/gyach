ElGyach TODO List
-----------------

* Add separate window support for private message conversations (like
  in ERC).

* Add "buddy" controls for private message conversations (like in
  Curphoo).

* Add scoring based on poster (like in Gnus).  Less interesting
  posters should appear in a gray font color, normal posters appear in
  black and more interesting posts appear in bold.

* Add a logging mechanism.  This should log the raw elgyach session
  to an emacs buffer and possibly save it periodically to disk.  Each
  entry should be time-stamped.

* Add support for avatars

* Add support for emoticons

* Make URLs click-able.

* Create and add a logo.  Add it to the ElGyach buffer when it starts.

* Make the post echoing behavior configurable.

* Add a command to turn on/off room enter/leave events

* Track users (so that a /chatters command shows a list of chatters
  present in the room)
