ElGyach BUG List
----------------

* The action prefix ":" shouldn't conflict with a ":)" (emoticon) at
  the beginning of a post.

* Navigation within the buffer (eg. M-v) is somehow conflicting with
  comint send routines, making it hard to move up the buffer without
  it scrolling back down.

* Various extraneous "\n" strings need to be stripped out.

* Shell output is not shown properly to the user (but is shown
  properly to other users).

* The current text properties customization is so poor, its a bug and
  not a to-do item ;)
