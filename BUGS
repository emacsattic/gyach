ElGyach BUG List
----------------

* Navigation within the buffer (eg. M-v) is somehow conflicting with
  comint send routines, making it hard to move up the buffer without
  it scrolling back down.

* Shell output is not shown properly to the user (but is shown
  properly to other users).

* When ignoring a user, it doesn't ignore their private messages.

* When ElGyach starts, it should load the .elgyach.el file if
  present.  If .elgyach.el is not present, then it should be created
  and initialized.
